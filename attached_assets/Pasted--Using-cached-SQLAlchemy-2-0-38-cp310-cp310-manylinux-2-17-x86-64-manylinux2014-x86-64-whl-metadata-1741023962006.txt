INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of langchain-community to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.
ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements.txt (line 6) and numpy==1.21.6 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested numpy==1.21.6
    langchain-community 0.3.18 depends on numpy<2 and >=1.26.4; python_version < "3.12"

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
